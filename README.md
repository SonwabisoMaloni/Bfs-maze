# Bfs-maze
Breadth first search pathfinding for a maze.
- This pogram takes in the 2-D size of a maze and then a depiction of the maze using "x", "S", and "G" for the walls, start and goal respectively.
- The point of the program is to show that breadth-first search pathfinding algorithm finds a path implemented in c++.
- Next phase of this program is to animate the maze
